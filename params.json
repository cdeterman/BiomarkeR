A second question usually posed in Biomarker\r\ninvestigations was which features are most important to such classification.\r\n\r\nI initially pursued the repositories of CRAN and Bioconductor.  I discovered such wonderful packages\r\nsuch as `caret` (which I highly recommend); however, I was unable to find a means of systematically \r\nrunning multiple algorithms in addition to stability metrics to provide confidence with features\r\nidentified as important.  This is critical as there seemed little practical benefit to classifying \r\n2+ groups if the features identified varied between each test.\r\n\r\nIn my readings, I came upon an excellent chapter in the Lecture Notes of Computer Science Vol. 5212 \r\nentitled 'Robust Feature Selection Using Ensemble Feature Selection Techniques' by Yvan Sayes, Thomas Abeel,\r\nand Yves Van de Peer.  From this chapter I decided to build this package, a tool to provide multiple \r\nmultivariate classification and feature selection techniques complete with multiple stability metrics and \r\naggregation techniques.  In this manner, this package provides a way to systematically compare both data perturbation \r\nand function perturbation ensemble techniques complete with a harmonic mean of feature robustness and classification \r\nperformance to evaluate the optimal model for the individual dataset.  This following David Wolpert's 'No Free Lunch\r\nTheorem' as there is no single model that is appropriate for all problems.\r\n\r\nI have made every effort to cite articles in which either the original technique was developed or applied. \r\nThe interested reader, as well you should be, is highly encouraged to seek out these articles.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nNo stable version currently submitted - may send to Bioconductor\r\n\r\nDevelopment version on [github](https://github.com/cdeterman/OmicsMarkeR)\r\n```r\r\n# development version\r\nlibrary(devtools)\r\ninstall_github('OmicsMarkeR',  username='cdeterman')\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Features in Progress\r\n1. Access to fitted models (averaged or all bootstrapped results?)\r\n2. Easy graphics access (scores/loadings plots, variable importance plots, etc.)\r\n3. Summary graphics (across models)\r\n4. Database searching (HMDB, MMCD, Metlin, LipidMaps, etc.)\r\n5. Additional algorithms\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
