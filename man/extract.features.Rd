\usage{
extract.features(x, dat = NULL, grp = NULL, method,
  model.features = FALSE, bestTune = NULL, f, comp.catch = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Previously fitted model}

\item{dat}{Numeric variable data used for fitted models
(In appropriate format)}

\item{grp}{Vector of training classes}

\item{method}{String indicating the INDIVIDUAL model being extracted from}

\item{model.features}{Logical argument dictating if features selected
determined by models instead of user determined number of features.}

\item{bestTune}{If \code{model.features = TRUE}, must provide the parameter
at which to extract features from the model.}

\item{f}{Number of features to subset}

\item{comp.catch}{An internal check for plsda models.  If the optimal model
contains only 1 component, the ncomp paramter must be set to 2 for the
model.  However, features are still extracted only from the first component.}
}
\value{
Returns list of the features selected from the fitted model.
}
\description{
Extracts features from models that have been previously fit.
