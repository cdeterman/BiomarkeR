\usage{
optimize.model(trainVars, trainGroup, method, k.folds = 10, repeats = 3,
  res = 3, grid = NULL, metric = "Accuracy", allowParallel = FALSE,
  verbose = "none", theDots = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{trainVars}{Data used to fit the model}

\item{trainGroup}{Group identifiers for the training data}

\item{method}{A vector of strings listing models to be optimized}

\item{k.folds}{Number of folds generated during cross-validation.
Default \code{"k.folds = 10"}}

\item{repeats}{Number of times cross-validation repeated.
Default \code{"repeats = 3"}}

\item{res}{Resolution of model optimization grid.  Default \code{"res = 3"}}

\item{grid}{Optional list of grids containing parameters to optimize 
for each algorithm. Default \code{"grid = NULL"} lets function 
create grid determined by \code{"res"}}

\item{metric}{Criteria for model optimization.  Available options 
are \code{"Accuracy"} (Predication Accuracy), \code{"Kappa"} 
(Kappa Statistic), and \code{"AUC-ROC"} 
(Area Under the Curve - Receiver Operator Curve)}

\item{allowParallel}{Logical argument dictating if parallel processing 
is allowed via foreach package}

\item{verbose}{Character argument specifying how much output progress 
to print. Options are 'none', 'minimal' or 'full'.}

\item{theDots}{List of additional arguments provided in the initial 
classification and features selection function}
}
\value{
Basically a list with the following elements:

\item{method}{Vector of strings listing models that 
were optimized}

\item{performance}{Performance generated internally to 
optimize model}

\item{bestTune}{List of paramaters chosen for each model}

\item{dots}{List of extra arguments initially provided}

\item{metric}{Criteria that was used for model optimization}

\item{finalModels}{The fitted models with the 'optimum' parameters}

\item{performance.metrics}{The performance metrics calculated 
internally for each resulting prediction}

\item{tune.metrics}{The results from each tune}

\item{perfNames}{The names of the performance metrics}

\item{comp.catch}{If the optimal PLSDA model contains only 1 
component, the model must be refit with 2 components.  This catches the 
1 component parameter so feature selection and further performance
analysis can be conducted on the 1 component.}
}
\description{
Optimizes each model based upon the parameters provided 
either by the internal \code{\link{denovo.grid}} function or by the user.
